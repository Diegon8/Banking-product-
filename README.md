## SUMMARY

As a brandnew data analyst I have been asked from a national bank to perform  an analysis over their current active loans in order to find strong spots for the creation of a new banking product. The idea is to do some targetting in order to aim our marketing strategy towards those clients with a higher conversion range(all those potential clients that are not attracted to the bank's current products).

With my analysis I search for those valleys in which the bank fails to convert clients. The three key factors to take into account are the Annual Income of our current customers, the expected age and the purpose of the loan. I will establish some ratios concerning Income, monthly debt, use of credit and total credit to understand the relation of the different groups of poblation towards the willingness to fall into debt.

## CONCLUSSION

My conclussion is that the bank needs to develop a modular loan for multiple holders. This loan's potential resides within the flexibility and low rates that it can offer. This bank product would give the opportunity to hire from 100$ to as much as 100,000$, and can have multiple holders which will enhance the rates, make the loan cheaper as the risk for the loan decreases.

A good name for this product could be 'Tandem'
